    "Language Processing *Finnegans Wake*\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will explore some tools in the [Python Natural Language Tool Kit](http://www.nltk.org/) and see what we can reveal of what might be a shameful choice of a warke.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to *Finnegans Wake* I'll do my best to explain some of the things I'm trying to examine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "When James Joyce published his infamous work of obliterature, *Finnegans Wake*, he wanted \"to keep the critics busy for 300 years\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It's been 75 years so maybe and some [Viconian thunderclaps](http://www.yourepeat.com/watch/?v=a11DEFm0WCw&start_at=347&end_at=390) later. We have new media through which we can clarify some of the obscurity of *The Wake*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "There are admittedly drawbacks to textual analysis of *Finnegans Wake*. Principally that *The Wake* is meant to be [read out loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8kFqiv8Vww). There's information, double, triple,..., Nth-le meaning, that's revealed when heard aloud. We're not gonna access that information heare, nor will we be able to pick up puns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Started\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "First we import the python libraries we'll be using and the text of Finnegans Wake itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you're having difficulty getting these running on your machine, I recommend checking out Anaconda for OSX, which handles python package installs relatively cleanly."
