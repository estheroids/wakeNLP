# wakeNLP
An iPython Notebook project for textual analysis of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake

### Getting Started

First things first
```
git clone https://github.com/spencerhitch/wakeNLP.git
```
If you've never used ipython notebook before then I'd recommend following the instructions to install ipython via anaconda from [ipython.org](http://ipython.org/install.html)

Once you've done that you'll need to also:
```
conda install nltk
``` 

Then `cd` into the proper directory and start 'er up with
```
ipython notebook wake.nlp
```
